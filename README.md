# Simulation of Portfolio Optimization

## Objective  
This project simulates the optimal portfolio allocation for two stocks: PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI) and PT Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI). The aim is to determine the best investment strategy based on historical stock prices from September 7 to September 13, 2022, with the objective of maximizing returns and minimizing risks.

## Data  
The study uses the following stock data:  
- **PT Bank Rakyat Indonesia (BBRI)**  
- **PT Bank Negara Indonesia (BBNI)**  
- **Data period**: September 7, 2022, to September 13, 2022  
- **Source**: [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com)

## Methods  
1. **Stock Price Simulation**: Stock price simulations are conducted using the closing prices of BBRI and BBNI for the past year.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: The mean, variance, and covariance of the stock returns are calculated.
3. **Portfolio Optimization**: The efficient frontier is computed to determine the best possible portfolio allocation based on return and risk trade-offs.

## Calculation
The calculation can be seen from this [link](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sSlGOZrDXVR72JeUIiGvRZ5T7LgLb6q_/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115310081003810230654&rtpof=true&sd=true) 

## Results  
- **Most efficient portfolio with the highest return**: Invest entirely in **BBNI** (Portfolio 1).
- **Most efficient portfolio with the lowest risk**: A **60:40 investment split** between **BBRI** and **BBNI** (Portfolio 7).
- Based on the simulation, the optimal strategy is to purchase **BBNI shares on Wednesday, September 7, 2022**, and sell on **Tuesday, September 13, 2022** for the highest profit.

## Conclusion  
The simulation demonstrates how portfolio optimization can be used to make informed investment decisions, balancing risk and return. The optimal strategy from this analysis suggests focusing on **BBNI** for maximum return or a balanced approach with **BBRI** for reduced risk.
